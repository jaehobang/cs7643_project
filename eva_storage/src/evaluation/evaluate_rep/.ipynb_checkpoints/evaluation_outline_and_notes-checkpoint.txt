1. We need to evaluate speed/accuracy vs non sampling -- try it on the whole dataset
2. We need to evaluate speed/accuracy vs uniform sampling -- try it on the whole dataset


To organize
We need to confirm the results on
a) machine learning models
b) deep learning models

Hence file should be

eva_vs_nop__ml - evaluate eva vs doing it against no operations on machine learning models  (done)
eva_vs_nop__dl - evaluate eva vs doing it against no operations on deep learning models
eva_vs_uni__ml - evaluate eva vs doing it against uniform sampling on machine learning models
eva_vs_uni__dl - evaluate eva vs doing it against uniform sampling on deep learning models

For evaluting with ml, we used linearsvm, random forest -- the implementation supplied by scikit learn
For training the filters, it is also important to define the distribution of the original dataset
We must also state the filters were trained on a task that is not directly related -- for example, it is not actually an image classification task? 



We can definitely confirm these results on other types of datasets as well....(2 more would be ideal)
